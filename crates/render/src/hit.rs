//! Hit-testing against the scene graph (ADR 0041).
//!
//! The scene is in page inches (ADR 0020); the caller converts the
//! tolerance from screen pixels (`pixels / (zoom * 96)`). Results come
//! topmost first: the caller picks the first hit it can select. Filled
//! shapes are hit on their fill, unfilled shapes on their outline and
//! text; groups are not hit directly (their leaf shapes are, and the
//! caller maps to the top-level ancestor through the model).
//!
//! The geometry math goes through `ferrogram_geom` (L0): paths are mapped
//! into page space through the node's ancestor transforms and measured
//! there, so `distance` is always in page inches even under a scaled or
//! rotated transform. Curve outlines flatten within
//! `ferrogram_geom::FLATTEN_TOLERANCE` (ADR 0022 flattening).
